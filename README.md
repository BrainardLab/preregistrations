# Brainard Lab Experiment Preregistrations

Experiments in the Brainard Lab are usually preregistered. This page organizes links to these pre-registration documents by project. We initially made use of the open science foundation website for this purpose, but we are moving towards simply committing documents to this repository, which accomplishes the same goal of establishing a date-and-time stamped record of our plans prior to embarking on an experiment. In some cases, depending on our collaborators, we use other mechanisms of pre-registration and link to them here.
