# Brainard Lab Experiment Preregistrations

Experiments in the Brainard Lab are usually preregistered. This page organizes links to these pre-registration documents by project. We sometimes make use of the [open science foundation](https://osf.io) website for this purpose, but also find reasonable simply committing preregistration documents to this repository. In some cases, depending on our collaborators or funding agency requirements, we use other mechanisms of pre-registration such as [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov).

[This page](https://github.com/BrainardLab/preregistrations/wiki/Older-Preregistrations) contains links to experiments we preregistered prior to 2021.

## RayleighForcedChoice

* [2021-04-15_OLRayleighMatch_PreRegistration](https://github.com/BrainardLab/preregistrations/blob/main/ForcedChoiceCM/RayleighForcedChoice/2012-04-15_OLRayleighMatch_PreRegistration.pdf)  - Preregistration for initial data collection in this project.  This file posted after 6 matches collected for Subject MELA_0034 and 2 matches collected for Subject MELA_0035.
* [2021-04-15_OLRayleighMatch_PreRegistration](https://github.com/BrainardLab/preregistrations/blob/main/ForcedChoiceCM/RayleighForcedChoice/2021-07-07_OLRayleighMatch_PreRegistration_Updated.pdf) - Preregistration for data collection on three new subjects with refined procedure.

## NaturalImageThresholds (with Cohen lab)

* [2021-08-12_NaturalImageThresholds_PreRegistration](https://github.com/BrainardLab/preregistrations/blob/main/NaturalImageThresholds/InitialExperiments_2021/2021-08-12_NaturalImageThresholds_PreRegistration.pdf)  - Preregistration for initial data collection in this project. This preregistration was posted to [ClinicalTrials.gov](ClinicalTrials.gov) in advance of the start of data collection: [NCT number: NCT05004649; protocol ID number 305435. The version there is archival](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05004649).

## Optoretinography (with Morgan lab)

* [2021-02-17 Test Reciprocity and Reliability of the Cone Optoretinogram](https://osf.io/sk78u/). This preregistration is not yet public. It provided preliminary data that informed the 2021-08-30 preregistration below.
* [2021-08-30 Measuring Cone Optoretinogram Reciprocity and Repeatability using Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Opthalmoscope](https://osf.io/xufdh/) - This preregistration is not yet public.
* [2021-09-15 Addendum on light power](https://osf.io/uah7m/) - This preregistration is not yet public.
