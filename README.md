# Brainard Lab Experiment Preregistrations

Experiments in the Brainard Lab are usually preregistered. This page organizes links to these pre-registration documents by project. We initially made use of the open science foundation website for this purpose, but we are moving towards simply committing documents to this repository, which accomplishes the same goal of establishing a date-and-time stamped record of our plans prior to embarking on an experiment. In some cases, depending on our collaborators or funding agency requirements, we use other mechanisms of pre-registration and link to them here.

[This page](https://github.com/BrainardLab/preregistrations/wiki/Older-Preregistrations) contains links to experiments we preregistered prior to 2021.

## RayleighForcedChoice

This preregistration was posted to [ClinicalTrials.gov](ClinicalTrials.gov) in advance of the start of data collection: [NCT number: NCT05004649; protocol ID number 305435. The version there is archival](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05004649).

## Optoretinography

* [2021-02-17 Test Reciprocity and Reliability of the Cone Optoretinogram](https://osf.io/sk78u/). This preregistration is not yet public. It provided preliminary data that informed the 2021-08-30 preregistration below.
* [2021-08-30 Measuring Cone Optoretinogram Reciprocity and Repeatability using Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Opthalmoscope](https://osf.io/xufdh/) - This preregistration is not yet public.
